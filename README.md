# MLOps-Internship
In this repository I have put down all the Project which I did during my MLOps Internship from LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd under the mentorship of World Record Holder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vimaldaga/">Mr. Vimal Daga sir</a>.

<b>Minor Project-1</b><br>
In this Minor-Project, I have created an Automated System implementing the concepts of branching and merging of Git/GitHub with Jenkins. To see the details of the Project and demonstration video <a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/DevOps-Integration/tree/master/DevOps%20Project-4">Click Here</a>.<br>

<b>Minor Project-2</b><br>
This Project I have done in appraches, One by using Jenkins, Docker and Git/GitHub and integrating these all together and another approach which I used was containerization within container which is more reliable and better approach than others.<br>

<b>Minor Project-3</b><br>
In this Project I have Created an Automated WorkFlow integrating Machine Learning with DevOps tools like, Docker and Jenkins. It will train my model untill the desired accuracy is not achieved in Docker Container having the environment of DeepLearning configured.

<b>Minor Project-4</b><br>
In this Project I have Created a Face Mask Detection System using the Transfer Learning. I have used the inception_v3 model for fine tuning and creating this project.
